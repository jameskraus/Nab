{"id":"nab-bhq4","title":"Display transfers differently and prevent accidental categorization","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen listing uncategorized transactions, transfers between accounts (payee starts with \"Transfer :\") show up as \"Uncategorized\". This is expected behavior in YNAB - transfers don't need categories since they're just moving money between your own accounts.\n\nHowever, this creates noise when reviewing transactions that need attention, and there's a risk of accidentally trying to categorize or modify transfer transactions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Display transfers differently in `tx list`**:\n   - Add a visual indicator or separate grouping for transfer transactions\n   - Consider a `--exclude-transfers` flag for `tx list` to filter them out\n   - Or show them in a distinct style (dimmed, different color, separate section)\n\n2. **Prevent accidental categorization**:\n   - `tx category set` should warn or refuse when targeting a transfer transaction\n   - Transfers in YNAB don't use categories - they use the transfer payee to track the flow\n\n3. **Detection logic**:\n   - Transfer transactions have `transfer_account_id` set (non-null)\n   - Payee name starts with \"Transfer :\"\n   - These can be reliably identified in the API response\n\n## Context\n\nDiscovered while building automated daily transaction review. The review fetches uncategorized transactions to surface items needing attention, but transfers cluttered the results since they're inherently \"uncategorized\" by design.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Transfers are visually distinct in `tx list` output\n- [ ] Option to exclude transfers from listing\n- [ ] Warning when attempting to categorize a transfer transaction","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-12T02:17:16.647706-05:00","created_by":"jameskraus","updated_at":"2026-01-14T23:24:23.062727-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-14T23:24:23.062727-05:00","close_reason":"Completed"}
